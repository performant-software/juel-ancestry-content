              ## Eu diam eget amet quam imperdiet


              Thomas Jefferson emulated Andrea Palladio’s depictions of
              classical architecture at the University of Virginia, both to
              implicitly uphold the democratic ideals of ancient Rome but also
              to elevate American architecture by serving as built models.
              However, this idea of democracy is in stark contrast to the
              realities of constructing and maintaining an early 19th century
              university in the American south. The truth is that Jefferson’s
              University was largely built by the labor of enslaved
              African-Americans. They did the hard work of leveling the Lawn’s
              terraces, hauling building materials, and digging foundations
              through bedrock. They were highly trained brick makers,
              carpenters, and stonemasons. The University’s records are silent
              on the vast majority of the enslaved individuals who made
              Jefferson’s designs a reality, but recent research has tried to
              identify the names of enslaved artisans and delve deeper into
              their stories.
