    title: The Enslaved
    subtitle: >-
      A great range of people were part of the University of Virginia in its
      early years, from those such as Jefferson who first envisioned the
      University, to those such as the laborers who physically constructed it.
      The academical village - as an intellectual conceit and architectural
      plan, a physical locale in an area then situated outside of
      Charlottesville, and an actual lived reality - involved faculty, students,
      laborers, hotelkeepers, women and children, townspeople, slaves,
      foreigners, and so on.

Delving into the JUEL records, one can find references to slaves, servants, laborers, \"Negros,\" domestics, hirelings, and free persons. Which terms were used, when, and to what purpose, will be here briefly described. \\[For related information, please see Ellen Eslinger's article, \"Free Black Residency in Two Antebellum Virginia Counties: How the Laws Functioned\" (Journal of Southern History\_79.2, May 2013, pp. 262-298)].\n"

              ##### *Freed Person*


              The law of 1793 of the Commonwealth of Virginia required all Freed
              Negroes to be registered. This law covered the period through
              1865. Some counties in Virginia kept separate registers, and many,
              of course, were lost during the Civil War. The registers, in
              effect, strove to keep track and regulate those who were free, in
              a manner that reveals that even free persons of color were yet
              subject to the visual policing as that of slaves. With
              descriptions that seek to detail the freed person as a physical
              body, we can see how such records acted much like a passport
              photograph. Persons were described as "black," "rather dark,"
              "bright mulatto," "dark mulatto," and so on, with descriptions of
              facial features ("pugnose," "straight nose") and hair ("bushy
              hair," "hair nearly strait \[sic]") that are comparative.
